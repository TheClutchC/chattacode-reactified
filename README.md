# Welcome to ChattaCode

A beginner dev community that creates equitable opportunities for people underrepresented in Chattanooga's tech industry. This is a turned project turned passion again, I hope to actually build this into something ethical and resourceful for the people in and around Chattanooga and potentially beyond :)

The initial build for the website is to get a feel for the layout and needs for the community.
